        Roll It uses slash commands to roll dice using different built-in dice mechanics. Slash commands are
        started by typing a ${inlineCode("/")} character and then the name of the command. Discord will suggest
        commands as you type. To accept a suggestion, click it from the list that pops up or hit the
        ${inlineCode("Tab")} key.

      "",
      oneLine`
        Commands usually accept one or more arguments. These are used to pass information to the command, like
        the size of a dice pool. Once you've selected a command, Discord will let you fill in
        its required arguments. When you're done with an argument, press ${inlineCode("Tab")} to move to the
        next one. After the required arguments have been filled out, Discord will show you the command's
        optional arguments in a list, like it did for the command names. Hit ${inlineCode("Tab")} or select
        the argument name to begin filling it in.

        Server managers can set which roll commands are available. See the help for the
        ${inlineCode("/roll-chooser")} command for more.
