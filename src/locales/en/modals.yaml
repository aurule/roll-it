      There is nothing to change, which is weird. This could happen if you save or edit a roll on multiple
      devices at once. Try again if you think it's a fluke.
    empty: You must give both a name and a description.
  response:
    error: Something went wrong. Sorry! You can try again, but it might not work until I've had a chance to fix things.
    success: Your roll is saved! Run `/saved roll name:{{name}}` to try it out!

      prompt: You already have a saved roll on this server named `{{name}}`. What do you want to do?
      choices:

        overwrite: Replace the Exiting Roll

      overwritten: Replaced the roll `{{name}}`. Run `/saved roll name:{{name}}` to try it out!
      retry: Let's try that again.
      timeout: Ran out of time. Leaving saved rolls unchanged.
