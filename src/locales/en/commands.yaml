      The three dice in the pool are added up to get the roll's result. This gives the result a strong
      average instead of the extremes of a single d20.
    - >
      Since the dice go from 3 to 18, and the chance of rolling either extreme is so low, the threshold
      for a critical result has to change. A critical success is when the dice add to 16 or more (before
      adding the {{opts.modifier}}), and a critical failure is when the dice add to 5 or less (also before
      adding the {{opts.modifier}}). {{cmd}} handles this for you.
    - >
      The {{opts.with}} option lets you roll two pools and take either the higher or lower result. Set it to
      `Advantage` to use the higher result, or `Disadvantage` to use the lower.

  help-lines:
    - >-
      The dice mechanics for {{cmd}} break down like this:
    - >-
      * All four pools ({{opts.discipline}}, {{opts.madness}}, {{opts.exhaustion}}, and {{opts.pain}}) are
      rolled separately.
    - >-
      * A die that rolls at or below 3 adds a success to its pool.
    - >-
      * The successes from the {{opts.discipline}}, {{opts.madness}}, and {{opts.exhaustion}} pools are added
      up and compared against the successes from the {{opts.pain}} pool. When {{opts.pain}} has more, you
      fail. When it has fewer or equal successes, you succeed.
    - >
      * The die results of each pool are compared again, this time from highest to lowest. The pool with the
      highest number on a die *dominates* the roll. If pools are tied for highest, then the
      next highest number is compared. If all pools are identical, then {{opts.discipline}} beats
      {{opts.madness}}, {{opts.madness}} beats {{opts.exhaustion}}, and {{opts.exhaustion}} beats
      {{opts.pain}}.
    - >
      Tip: The printed results not only show what dominated the roll, but underline the reason why it did so.
    - >-
      The {{opts.talent}} can modify the number of successes you compare against the {{opts.pain}} result:
    - >-
      * Minor Exhaustion prevents you from getting fewer successes than your {{opts.exhaustion}} pool.
      {{opts.exhaustion}} has to be at least 1.
    - >-
      * Major Exhaustion adds one success to your result per die of {{opts.exhaustion}}. {{opts.exhaustion}}
      has to be at least 1.
    - >
      * Madness is required to do magic. It does not change your successes, but does ensure that
      {{opts.madness}} is at least 1.
    - >
      If you're helping another player, you can set {{opts.pain}} to zero and just roll your
      {{opts.discipline}}. They can then set {{opts.modifier}} to add your successes to their result. You
      cannot use {{opts.exhaustion}}, {{opts.madness}}, {{opts.talent}}, or {{opts.modifier}} when helping
      another.

  description: Roll a combination of dice and complex modifiers
  help-lines:
      - >
        {{cmd}} rolls multiple pools of dice at once and can add, subtract, and manipulate them using complex
        math. It's especially useful when you need to add a bunch of dice pools together, like for magic weapon
        damage rolls in D&D.
      - >
        Each formula should include at least one pool of dice, written as `dice`d`sides`. If you want to
        label the outcome of a pool, you can add a label in quotes to the `sides`, like `1d6"fire"`.
      - >
        When run, {{cmd}} rolls every pool and then evaluates the math of the formula. This means that while
        you can manipulate the outcome of multiple pools, you cannot manipulate the number of dice nor their
        sides.
      - >-
        Here are a few examples where a formula is more helpful than rolling plain dice:
      - >-
        * A magic weapon damage roll of 2d4 slashing, 1d6 fire, and 1d6 holy, with a +6 bonus:
        `2d4"slash" + 1d6"fire" + 1d6"holy" + 6`
      - >-
        * A D&D 3.5 crafting roll with a DC of 20: `(1d20 + 16) * 20`
      - >-
        * A crit damage roll in D&D 5e: `(1d8 + 4) * 2 + 1d6"holy"`
      - >
        * A VtM Sabbat vinculum check for multiple participants in a vaulderie:
        `1d10"Marie" + 1d10"Jane" + 1d10"Foxfire"`. In this case, the labels are the important part and the
        final sum doesn't matter.
      - >
        When used as a saved roll, {{cmd}} accepts a `modifier` like all other savable rolls. Its modifier is
        limited to adding or subtracting a single number.
      - >-
        {{cmd}} uses [math.js](<https://mathjs.org>) under the hood to do the calculations, so it respects
        proper order of operations and can do all sorts of fancy math. Read up on its
        [syntax guide](<https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/syntax.html>) and
        [supported functions](<https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html>) if there's something really
        wild you want to try. Keep in mind that {{cmd}} resolves all dice pools *before* any other operation is
        evaluated.

  help-lines:
    - >-
      The core dice mechanics for {{cmd}} break down like this:
    - >-
      * A die that rolls at or above the {{opts.threshold}} value (normally 8) adds a success
    - >
      * A die that rolls at or above the {{opts.explode}} value (normally 10) adds another die to the roll.
      This is called 10-again.
    - >
      Sometimes you don't get the 10-again benefit. In that case, set {{opts.explode}} to 11 and the dice will
      not re-roll.
    - >-
      There are also some special mechanics that are supported, even though they don't come up very often:
    - >-
      * When {{opts.rote}} is true, every die in your *initial* pool that fails to score a success adds another
      die to the roll
    - >-
      * When your {{opts.pool}} is zero, you get a single "chance" die. This interacts with {{opts.rote}} in a
      weird way; {{cmd}} handles it, but see *World of Darkness* p.135 for details.
    - >
      * When {{opts.decreasing}} is true, each roll after the first has its {{opts.pool}} lowered by one. So the
      first roll uses the full pool, the second roll has a -1 penalty, the third has -2, etc. This
      implements the book rule of a cumulative penalty on retries. It has no effect unless {{opts.rolls}} is more
      than 1, or {{opts.until}} is used.
    - >
      Besides these options, {{cmd}} can automate a couple of tedious mechanics.
    - >
      Certain actions need to be made until a given number of successes are accrued. The {{opts.until}} option
      tells Roll It to do so, rolling as many times as it takes to meet or exceed the number supplied. In
      this mode, {{opts.rolls}} limits the total number of attempts that are allowed before a final result is
      shown. When {{opts.decreasing}} is true, the pool will shrink by one with each roll as described above.
    - >
      The {{opts.teamwork}} option starts a special teamwork roll that lets other people add dice to your
      pool by responding to a prompt. This is not compatible with the {{opts.rolls}}, {{opts.until}}, or
      {{opts.secret}} options. $t(shared.teamwork)
    - >-
      Although {{cmd}} is happy to roll a chance die, you have to have a {{opts.pool}} of at least 1

      Occasionally, a character is able to roll 3 or more dice and keep the highest two. This is fully
      supported by using the {{opts.pool}} option. When more than two dice are rolled using {{cmd}},
      only the highest two are kept.

      Equally rarely, a character is able to re-roll any 1s that appear for their skill dice. For this, set
      the {{opts.reroll-1s}} option to `true`.

      The {{cmd}} commands let you create and roll random results from a table. Each subcommand has its own
      help entry you can read for more details.
    - >
      Tables are unique to each server and can only be used by server managers and those they allow through
      Discord's permissions.
    - >
      In general, you'll use {{sub.add}} to create one or more tables, then {{sub.roll}} to get a random entry
      from one of them.
    - >
      You can use {{sub.list}} to see which tables are available on the server.
    - >
      {{sub.manage}} lets you see the details and full contents of a table, as well as remove it from the
      server. If you need to change something about a table, like tweak its name or change an entry, you'll
      have to remove the table and then add it back with the desired changes.

        {{cmd}} creates a new rollable table on this server. Once added, you can use `/table roll` to get a
        random result from its entries.
      - >
        When adding a table, you have to upload a text file containing the table's entries. Each line of the
        file will become a single entry in the table. Be careful that you don't leave any blank lines, titles,
        or other notes in the file that you use, because these *will* show up as entries in the table.
      - >
        If you aren't sure you that your file is a plain text file, open it with your text editor of choice
        and save it as `Plain Text` with the extension `.txt`.

        1. Each table on a server has to have a unique name. You'll get an error if it's taken.
      - >-
        2. The name and description both have to be at least three characters long.
      - >-
        3. The entries file has to have at least two lines, and has to be smaller than 5 megabytes. That's
        roughly the size of a full-length novel.

      The dice mechanics for {{cmd}} break down like this:

      * A die that rolls at or above the {{opts.difficulty}} value adds a success
    - >-
      * A die that rolls a 1 subtracts a success

      * If no dice score a success and one or more dice rolled a 1, the final result is a botch

      The {{opts.specialty}} option makes any die that rolls a 10 add *two* successes
      instead of one. The {{opts.rolls}} option lets you roll the same pool and difficulty multiple
      times, like for NPCs.
    - >
      The {{opts.until}} option tells Roll It to continue rolling the same pool and difficulty until the total
      successes meet or exceed the number given. In this mode, the {{opts.rolls}} option limits the maximum
      number of rolls allowed.

      The {{opts.teamwork}} option starts a special teamwork roll that lets other people add dice to
