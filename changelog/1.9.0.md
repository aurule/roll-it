# Changelog for Roll It v1.9.0

Want to play real rock-paper-scissors in Discord? Guess what! There's now a command for it! Choose what you throw, declare ties, retests, etc. all within the command, and directly challenge your opponent!

## Added

* New `/met static` and `/met opposed` commands for better handling of MET rules
* The `/curv` roller now calls out critical results

## Changed

* Deprecated `/chop` in favor of `/met opposed`. Once the `/met` commands are field tested and stable in a future update, `/chop` will be removed.
* `Save this roll` now uses locally cached data, since Discord no longer sends command names
