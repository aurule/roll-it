# Changelog for Roll It v1.12.0

This release completely overhauls the way teamwork tests are handled for `/nwod`, `/shadowrun`, and `/wod20`. It should be much more resilient against Discord's flakyness, as well as clearer and easier to use.

## Added

* New teamwork handling for `/nwod`, `/shadowrun`, and `/wod20`
* Roll It can now respond to mentions and replies
* New `/d8` roller
* More sacrificial fun
* Performance logging to investigate intermittent failures

## Changed

* Renamed `/roll-formula` to `/formula`
* Allow `/table` commands to be used by all users

## Fixed

* The `/chop` command accepts descriptions again
