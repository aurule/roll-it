# Changelog for Roll It v1.6.0

## Added

There's a brand new big feature! Roll It now supports **Saved Rolls**! By using some new commands, you can save a commonly-used roll -- complete with its pool, modifier, and all the other options -- and re-use it later. You can even tweak the saved options with a `bonus` when you roll. Check out the help text for `/saved` or jump right in with `/saved set`!

This feature makes use a new kind of command for Roll It: the message context command. Instead of typing a slash followed by the command name, you right click a message (on desktop) or long press a message (on phone/tablet), then select `Apps` and finally `Save this roll`. It's a pretty convenient way to save a command you've just used.

On to the rest of the changes:

* New `/d10` command to quickly roll a single ten-sided die
* Added `rolls` option to `/roll-formula` for repeated rolls
* Show explicit "with advantage" or "with disadvantage" to `/d20` rolls where `keep` was specified

## Changed

* Rename the `/d20` command's `advantage` option to `keep`
* Added limits to rolls, until, and dice pools:
    - Rolls are capped at 100
    - Until is capped at 100
    - Pools are capped at 1000
* Added 1500 char limit to description and `/roll-formula` formula

## Fixed

* Added missing description of the `keep` advantage option in the help text for `/d20`
* Prevent errors during table selection when there are more than 25 tables
* Negative modifiers are now formatted more naturally
