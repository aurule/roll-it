# Changelog for Roll It v1.9.2

## Added

* New `/help feedback` command to send me your feedback
* There's now a link to [support me on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/paige2501)
* The prompt to respond to `/met opposed` now explains that you have to declare bomb and ties

## Changed

* Each result in `/met opposed` now shows the chop of that test's leader first. Hopefully this will reduce confusion.

## Fixed

* Added deprecation notice to the help for `/chop`
* Added [migration guide](https://aurule.github.io/roll-it/#/systems/met?id=migrating-to-met-static) for moving from `/chop` to `/met static` on the website
* Opposed MET tests no longer ignore `use-retests:False`
* Followup messages in `/met opposed` now time out properly
