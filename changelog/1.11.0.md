# Changelog for Roll It v1.11.0

This release dramatically improves the experience of saving a roll. Check out the [saved rolls guide](https://aurule.github.io/roll-it/#/features/saved), in-app help, or just dive in with the *Save this roll* command from the right-click menu.

## Added

* New `/ffrpg` roller for the *Final Fantasy RPG 3e* system
* Added `carrier` and `altering` flags to `/met opposed` roller

## Changed

* Use server locale for teamwork and met-opposed
* Reworked Saved Rolls to use a popup window to get the name and description for a new roll, instead of a separate command
* Saved rolls no longer have the confusing `incomplete` state. Roll It now shows a popup for setting the name and description.

## Removed

* `/saved set` has been replaced by better interactivity in *Save this roll*

## Fixed

* Stopped the hummingbird from crashing `/nwod` and `/wod20`
* Saved rolls list would always claim you had one roll, even with multiple listed
* Saved rolls list did not translate shared options
