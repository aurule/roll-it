# Changelog for Roll It v1.9.5

## Changed

* Renamed `/roll-chooser` to `/setup-roll-it`
* Increases the response timer for `/met opposed` from 5 to 10 minutes
* Require both participants to click Throw during a retest in `/met opposed`
* Show new rps chop emoji when a throw is confirmed in `/met opposed` retests

## Fixed

* The prompt to cancel a retest during `/met opposed` should work again
* Retest reason is now saved per user, so you won't accidentally retest using the other participant's reason
