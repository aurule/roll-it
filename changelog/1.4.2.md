# Changelog for Roll It v1.4.2

## Added

* You can now call heads or tails for your `/coin` toss with the `call` option
* The bot now shows a status message

## Changed

* The `until` option for `/nwod` now works when you have a chance die (a pool of zero). It's probably a bad idea IC, but you can roll it!

## Fixed

* The `/nwod` command now shows "a chance die" instead of a pool of "1" when rolling a chance die
* Error when trying to display too many results
* Improved where long help messages get broken into pages
* The results for `/nwod` now correctly pluralize "die" and "dice"
* The results for an `/nwod` chance die with rote now show "10!!" when the first die is a success
