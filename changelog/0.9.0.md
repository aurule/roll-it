# Changelog for Roll It v0.9.0

This is the first public release of Roll It!

Most of the planned commands have been implemented and more are still to come. So far, here's what's available:

`/chop` - Play a round of rock-paper-scissors
`/coin` - Flip a coin
`/fate` - Roll four fudge dice
`/roll` - Roll some dice

You can get help with any of these, or about certain topics, using the `/roll-help` command. Have fun!
