# Welcome to Roll It!

Roll It is a Discord bot for rolling dice.

I made it because I wanted to run tabletop games over Discord, and there weren't any dice rollers that correctly implemented the roll mechanics I wanted to use. Since tallying dice by hand is annoying on a digital screen, I made Roll It to do it for me! Since then, it's grown to support more dice systems and have more features.

## Features

* Commands for 8 distinct dice systems, supporting over a dozen distinct game lines.
* Saving rolls for re-use without typing all the options again
* Rolling random results on custom tables
* And more!

> One of the best things about Roll It is its ability to repeat a roll many times over. It's invaluable when I'm running a game and comes in handy when I'm playing a crafter, too. See the `rolls` option — and sometimes the `until` option — of a roller you're interested in to learn more.

## Quick Start

It's easy to use Roll It!

1. Add the bot to your server: [Install Roll It](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1037522511509848136)
2. Run the command `/roll-chooser` and pick which dice systems you want to have on your server
3. Roll some dice!

## Getting Help

If you aren't familiar with something, you can use Roll It's built-in `/help` command. This shows detailed help information about every command in Roll It and can walk you through more general help topics.

If you aren't familiar with slash commands, don't worry! Discord has you covered. Check out this [help article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) which explains them.

# Privacy

I take privacy very seriously. Roll It only requests permissions to accept slash commands (to roll the dice) and show custom emojis (to make the results of `/fate` look fancy). No message contents, no membership info, and nothing invasive.
