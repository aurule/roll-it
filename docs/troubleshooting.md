# Troubleshooting

Info about certain problems and how to fix them.

When in doubt, if something doesn't look right, right-click the offending command response (or long press on mobile) and select the context command *Report this roll...* to let me know. Fill in as much detail as you can! It really helps to work out what went wrong.

## Discord says "The application did not respond"

This often happens because Discord does not wait long enough for a response from Roll It. Give it a few seconds, and a response should appear. If it doesn't, try sending the command again. If that doesn't work, then something may actually be broken. You can use *Report this roll...* to send the details to me, and all errors get logged anyway. Rest assured that I'll take a look and try to fix any misbehaving commands as soon as I can.

## My `/met opposed` challenge stalled out

This is also usually because of how Discord itself handles things. Try replying to one of the messages from Roll It about your challenge with the word `retry`. That lets Roll It know to send a new message that will (hopefully) work.

Of course, it's possible that Discord *isn't* to blame this time. In that case, use *Report this roll...* on the very first response -- the one sent after you used `/met opposed` -- and I'll try to work out what went wrong.

## A command I need to use is missing

If it's a command you know exists, it could be that your server doesn't have it installed. Ask your admin to install it using `/setup-roll-it`. If it doesn't exist yet, use `/help feedback` to tell me about the game system! I can't promise it'll get added, but more voices asking for one does make it more likely.
