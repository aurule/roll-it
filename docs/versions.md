## 1.6.0 <small>Released Aug 9, 2024</small>

There's a brand new big feature! Roll It now supports [**Saved Rolls**](/features/saved)! By using some new commands, you can save a commonly-used roll -- complete with its pool, modifier, and all the other options -- and re-use it later. You can even tweak the saved options with a `bonus` when you roll. Check out the help text for `/saved` using [`/help command:saved` invocation] or jump right in with `/saved set`!

This feature makes use a new kind of command for Roll It: the message context command. Instead of typing a slash followed by the command name, you right click a message (on desktop) or long press a message (on phone/tablet), then select `Apps` and finally `Save this roll`. It's a pretty convenient way to save a command you've just used.
