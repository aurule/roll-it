# Sending Feedback

If you want to send your throughts about Roll It to its developer, you can use `/feedback` to do so. Good things, bad things, unexpected things, broken things, suggestions, etc. are all welcome.

If your feedback is about a specific command, I'd appreciate it if you include the `command` option. This is especially true for bugs, since it helps me track them down faster.

It's rare that I'll need to reach out and chat about most feedback. If it does come up, I don't want to DM you out of the blue. So if you're comfortable receiving DMs from me, set `consent` to `Yes` so that I know it's ok. Otherwise, I will *not* DM you about that piece of feedback. `consent` defaults to `No`.

!> It should go without saying that `/feedback` should not be used for harrassment or hate. If you spam it or say vile things, you'll lose access to `/feedback` for some amount of time, possibly forever. So please don't be a jerk!

In legal language: I reserve the right to ban any user, at my sole discretion and at any time and for any duration, from sending messages via `/feedback`.

## `/feedback`

Sends feedback to the developer.

* `message` is text that you want to send
* `command` is the command the feedback is about, if applicable
* `consent` is whether I can DM you about your feedback. Defaults to `No`.
