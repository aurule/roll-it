# Reporting a Roll

Despite our best efforts, things sometimes don't work right. In Roll It, there's a command to report a malfunction so that it can get fixed for later.

*Report this roll...* is a context command that lets you right-click (or long press) on a misbehaving command and send it to me, the developer.

?> A context command is a bot action that is not typed out, but is used through a menu within Discord. To get to that menu, you need to take different steps depending on whether you're using Discord on your phone or on a computer. With a phone, you long-press on a message to show the menu. On a computer, you right-click the message. Once that context menu shows up, you select the `Apps` item and a smaller menu opens up. That's where you can find _Report this roll..._.

When should you report a roll? The main reason would be if a roll command shows the wrong outcome, or does not respond.

!> Be sure to wait a few seconds before reporting a missing roll. Sometimes Discord doesn't wait long enough before claiming that the bot did not respond.
